Developed a scalable client-server architecture featuring a main server and mirror servers to facilitate concurrent client communications via sockets, 
implementing round-robin load balancing for efficient resource management and fault-tolerant request handling. 
Utilized threading to manage multiple client connections efficiently on a single server, ensuring seamless communication and optimized resource utilization. 
Integrated file manipulation functionalities, including search, copy, move, and listing operations, with support for user-specified arguments and options, 
alongside traversal functions for efficient file tree navigation. 
Implemented shell functionality by leveraging fork, pipes, and exec system calls to execute shell commands seamlessly. 
Additionally, engineered a background-running bash script automating a comprehensive backup system, encompassing incremental, 
complete, and differential backups of files within the root directory tree, with periodic updates to the backup log ensuring data integrity.
